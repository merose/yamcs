Upload Object
=============

Upload an object::

    POST /api/archive/:instance/:bucketName/objects/:objectName
    POST /api/archive/:instance/:bucketName/objects

``_global`` can be used as instance name to upload to a bucket at the global level.

If the bucketName is ``user.username`` the bucket will be created automatically if it does not exist. Otherwise the bucket must exist before being used.


.. rubric:: Simple upload

In case of simple upload, the objectName has to be specified as part of the URL and the Content-Type header has to be set to the type of the object. The body of the request is the object data.


.. rubric:: Form upload

The form based upload can be used to upload an object from an HTML form. In this case the Content-Type of the request is set to ``multipart/form-data``, and the body will contain at least one part which is the object data. This part includes a filename which is used as the object name as well as a Content-Type header. The name attribute for the file part is ignored.
Additional parts (which do not specify a filename) will be used as metadata: the name is specified as part of the Content-Disposition and the value is the body of the part.

This can be tested using the curl with the ``-F`` option.


.. rubric:: Example
.. code-block::

    POST /api/buckets/_global/my_bucket HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:8090
    User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
    Accept: */*
    Content-Length: 1090
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------------------7109c709802f7ae4

    --------------------------7109c709802f7ae4
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="object/name"
    Content-Type: text/plain

    [object data]
    --------------------------7109c709802f7ae4
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name1"

    value1
    --------------------------7109c709802f7ae4
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name2"

    value2
    --------------------------7109c709802f7ae4--


This will create an object named ``object/name`` with two metadata properties:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name1": "value1",
        "name2": "value2"
    }
